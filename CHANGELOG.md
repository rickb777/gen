###3 Jan 2015

Added [stringer](https://github.com/rickb777/stringer) as a built-in typewriter.

###30 Nov 2014 (v4)

To get the latest: `go get github.com/rickb777/gen`. Type `gen help` to see usage.

(Because the go.tools import path has changed, you may see import errors. You may wish to delete the code.google.com folder from your $GOPATH/src and maybe from /pkg too. Heck, go ahead delete your $GOPATH/src/github.com/rickb777 folder to start clean.)

This release has several substantial changes.

####Type parameters

Tags now have support for type parameters, for example:

	// +gen foo:"Bar[qux], Qaz[thing, stuff]"
	type MyType struct{}
	
Those type parameters (qux, thing, stuff) are properly evaluated as types, and passed to your typewriters.

####Type constraints

Speaking of above, types are evaluated for Numeric, Ordered and Comparable. Templates, in turn, can have type constraints.

For example, you can declare your Sum template only to be applicable to Numeric types, and your Set to Comparable types.

####gen add

Third-party typewriters are added to your package using a new command, `add`. It looks like this:

	gen add github.com/rickb777/set
	
That’s a plain old Go import path.

After adding, you can mark up a type like:

	// +gen set slice:"GroupBy[string], Select[Foo]"
	type MyType struct{}

As always, it’s up to the third-party typewriter to determine behavior. In this case, a “naked” `set` tag is enough.

We deprecated the unintuitive `gen custom` command, `add` replaces it.

####gen watch

...will watch the current directory and `gen` on file changes.

####Explcitness

Previous versions of gen would generate a dozen or so LINQ-style slice methods simply by marking up:

	// +gen
	type MyType struct{}
	
We’ve opted for explicitness moving forward – in the case of slices, you’ll write this instead:

	// +gen slice:"Where, SortBy, Any"
	type MyType struct{}

In other words, only the methods you want.

####Projections

Certain methods, such as Select and GroupBy require an additional type parameter. I won’t bore you with the convoluted old way. Now it’s:

	// +gen slice:"GroupBy[string], Select[Foo]"
	type MyType struct{}

Those type parameters are properly evaluated, and typewriters get full type information on them.

####slice

The main built-in typewriter used to be called `genwriter`, it is now called `slice`. Instead of the generated slice type being called Things, it’s now called ThingSlice.

[slice](https://github.com/rickb777/slice) is now the only built-in typewriter.

We’ve deprecated the built-in container typewriter, instead splitting it into optional [Set](https://github.com/rickb777/set), [List](https://github.com/rickb777/linkedlist) and [Ring](https://github.com/rickb777/ring) typewriters.

You can add them using the `add` command described above:

	gen add github.com/rickb777/linkedlist

####Smaller interface

For those developing their own typewriters: the [`TypeWriter` interface](https://github.com/rickb777/typewriter/blob/master/typewriter.go) got smaller. It’s now:

	type TypeWriter interface {
		Name() string
		Imports(t Type) []ImportSpec
		Write(w io.Writer, t Type) error
	}

`Validate` is gone, it was awkward. The easy fix there was to allow Write to return an error. `WriteHeader` is gone, there was little use for it in practice. `WriteBody` is now simply `Write`.

We also run [goimports](https://godoc.org/golang.org/x/tools/imports) on generated code, so if your typewriter only uses the standard library, you might not need to specify anything for Imports() -- they’ll automagically be added to the generated source.

Let me (@rickb777) know if any questions.

###28 Jun 2014 (v3)

To get the latest: `go get -u github.com/rickb777/gen`. Type `gen help` to see commands.

This release introduces the optional `_gen.go` file for importing custom typewriters.

Prior to this release, typewriters were simply part of the `gen` binary. Now, by creating a file of the above name in your package, third-party typewriters can be included at runtime.

`cd` into your package and type `gen custom`. You will see a new `_gen.go` file which looks like this:

```
package main

import (
	_ "github.com/rickb777/containerwriter"
	_ "github.com/rickb777/typewriters/genwriter"
)
```

Change those import paths to other, third-party typewriters. Then call `gen get`. `gen list` is helpful too.

Docs on how to create a typewriter are coming soon. In the meantime, have a look at the [container](https://github.com/rickb777/gen/tree/master/typewriters/container) typewriter for a decent example.

###12 Jun 2014

A new architecture based on ‘typewriters’. Ideally you should see little change, but…

This was a long-lived branch, around 6 weeks. The architecture should be a lot better, as well as the testing. But of course regressions are possible.

I will mark this with a release 2.0 tag following semver conventions, since there are some behavioral changes. If there are regressions for you, you can use gopkg.in to stick with 1.0.

A few important behavioral changes:

- Each typewriter now outputs a separate file, eg `*_gen.go` and `*_container.go`. This should not be a breaking change. Formerly, there was a single `*_gen.go` file
- Previously-gen’d files which have been ‘un-gen’d’ (i.e. removed a tag) will not be deleted as before. Do this manually if need be, but I hope it’s an edge case. Will consider adding it back in.
- The `-force` flag is gone. Officially, it was undefined behavior, intended for use if you get yourself into a jam.
- The contents of your gen’d files may be slightly different, but their behavior should be unchanged.

We are going to exploit this architecture to do some ~~evil~~ interesting things, stay tuned.

Any trouble, please let me know via a GitHub issue, or [Twitter](http://twitter.com/rickb777), or…

###9 Mar 2014

Preliminary support for containers, starting with Set, List and Ring. The use case is to generate a strongly-typed container, to avoid the overhead of casting (type assertions), and to add compile-time safety.

###1 Feb 2014

gen will now delete `*_gen.go` files in the case that a previously-gen’d type has been removed, per #34. Confirms with the user for safety. And of course you are using version control, right?

Added new `Max` and `Min` (alongside the existing respective *By). The difference is that these work on types that are known ordered such as type MyOrderable int. It requires no passed ‘less’ func because we already know what ‘less’ is for such types. #28.

MaxBy(less) and MinBy(less) are still the way to go for structs or ad-hoc ordering.

###30 Jan 2014

Added new `Sort` (alongside the existing `SortBy`). The difference is that Sort works on types that are known sortable such as `type MySortable int`. It requires no passed ‘less’ func because we already know what ‘less’ is for such types. :)

`SortBy(less)` is still the way to go for structs or any ad-hoc sorts.

The ‘integration tests’ (those which test the gen’d code) have been rewritten for clarity.

Generated code is now passed through the go/format package (gofmt) on output, so you don’t have to.

###26 Jan 2014

This release includes breaking changes. To update:

`go get -u github.com/rickb777/gen`

Command-line type specification has been deprecated, and replaced by markup per #23. It takes the form of:

```
// +gen
type MyType struct {...}
Where before the command-line would be gen package.Type, now it's simply gen, which will locate and process your marked-up types.
```
Here's a larger example:

```
// +gen * methods:"Count,Where" projections:"SomeType,int"
type MyType struct {...}
```

- The * is a directive to generate methods which take a pointer type instead of a value type. Optional but recommended.
- The methods tag is for subsetting methods; replaces gen:"...". Optional; omit it to generate all standard methods.
- The projections tag specifies types to be projected for methods such as Select and GroupBy. Optional. If the methods tag is omitted, all projection methods will be generated, appropriate to each type. (For example, Average will not be generated for non-numeric types.) You can subset projection methods using the methods tag above.
- The -all flag has been deprecated, it's no longer a valid use case, given the above. The -exported flag, which is a modifier of same, is gone too.

Custom methods, where specific member fields of a struct are marked up, have been deprecated. The rationale is that we prefer to project types, not fields.

Sort(func) has been renamed SortBy(func), and similarly Max → MaxBy, Min → MinBy. This is done in anticipation of methods of those names which will not take a func, see #28.
